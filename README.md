# Vite + React App

This repository contains a React application built with Vite, showcasing various components for a user profile interface. The app includes components such as Navbar, Post, Profile, and Toggle.

## Components

### Navbar.jsx
The `Navbar` component renders the navigation bar with a logo and a toggle button. It accepts props for handling dark mode (`isDark`) and change events (`handleChange`).
